        <p>
          At the end of my first year at Oregon State University, I stumbled across a TED talk about flag design.
          This lead me to a podcast called 99% invisible, a series about all the design elements that go unnoticed in our modern world.
          The conversation on design was a breath of fresh air from the math and C++ programing courses that dominated the last 6 months of my life.
          From then on, I became obsessed with focusing my studies in computer science on making our electronic world feel more human.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my sophomore year, I created a custom focus in Human Computer Interactions and Graphic Design to learn how to translate the power of computation into a form that was approachable, understandable and beautiful.
          My web development experience has taught me how to build a product that is friendly to both a user and a developer, and I seek to apply those skills towards work that improves people’s lives.

          Ninkasi Brewing Company is based in Eugene, Oregon, producing and distributing nearly 100,000 barrels of beer each year across the United States and Canada.
          The company has grown rapidly over the last few years and their success has been difficult to keep up with.
          The process they were using to manage the data generated by brewing was slow and time consuming.
          Two fellow students and I reached out to the brewmaster at the company to inform them about the senior project that our University hosts.
          Over the course of our senior year, a team of three computer science students get together and design, implement and release software to fit the needs of the client.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our team has taken full advantage of this opportunity and we have been continuously providing work that has overdelivered on both our client and instructors expectations.
          During our winter break in 2017, I personally corresponded with the brewmaster at Ninkasi and went through several iterations of design for their user interface.
          I created the mockups in Adobe XD, and after reaching a prototype that both the brewmaster and I were happy with, I visited the company headquarters on my own to both demonstrate what I had built and to get feedback from a focus group of brewers and managers at Ninkasi.
          I gave the presentation, ran through use cases and found several changes that needed to be made to both the database and the user interface.
          I implemented the changes during the meeting, and left with a version that everyone was excited about.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since then, I have implemented the web user interface on our project using webpack, html, stylus, and Vue.js to create a web app responsive to both desktop and mobile devices.
          We are still in the process of developing the product, and expect to have the product ready to deploy within the company by the end of spring.

          CDK is a multi-national company that leads the market in automotive dealer management systems.
          I worked as an intern in a special division within the company that was in charge of developing applications for internal company use.
          During my first few weeks I focused on training and learning new tools.
          I learned AngularJS, and agile methodology while working on bringing an app to version 2 release.
          I took the lead in redesigning the user interface and collaborated with my co-workers on a variety of tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our team was comprised of two groups, half in downtown Portland, Oregon, and the other half in Pune, India.
          Over my ten weeks there, I built experience working both in office environments as well as working remotely with an overseas group.
        </p>

        <p>
          Halfway through my internship, our company sponsored a hackathon for senior employees and interns alike.
          I collaborated with two other interns in my group and we created a new web app for the company in four days.
          We held presentations on the fifth day and showed our web app to several hundred people in the company.
          The Chief Global Strategy officer for the company officer notice of our team and told us that he wanted us to continue development of our product with the idea that this could be released to both the company and as a standalone company.
          Our mentor and boss was gracious enough to let the original team of myself and the two other interns to continue development on the project.
          We drafted a business proposal over the next two weeks while we continued to develop our application.
          By the end of my internship, our intern team had both brought our mentors app to version 2 and deployed our own app to servers within the company.

          While working as a TA for the Intro to CS course, and as the front-end developer on a graduate student startup project, I was contacted by a Physics professor that was interested in creating an open source physics textbook for his students and releasing it on an online platform.
          He had received an educational grant to develop his book, and he hired six physics students to build the content of his book.
          He still needed a developer, so he reached out to other professors around the university in the computer science department.
          I was the first recommendation for his project and he contacted me asking if I could work with him on his project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I joined the team when summer break began in June, and worked through September on implementing the content generated by the physics students.
          They needed the site to run in Drupal 7 so it could make use of the data tracking modules for research on how to improve the textbook.
          We finished the project before his fall courses began and he has been using it for the last year and a half.He needed occasional fixes through December and I was happy to help though the funding ran out at the end of September.
          I believed strongly in the idea to create a fun, interactive and free text-book, so I offered my services whenever he needed it and I had the time to help.

          My longest running job has been working as a TA for the Intro to Computer Science courses at Oregon State University.
          There are three courses, CS 160, 161, 162, each one building directly on the other and taught by a small group of instructors that closely communicate with each other and treat those courses as one long course.
          The CS 160 course is an introduction to programming with a focus on concepts and beginning to program with python.
          CS 161 focuses on programming in C++, and though it is often tough for most students to work with a relatively low-level programming language such as C++, they have a deeper understanding about how programming languages work as a whole.
          CS 162 is an introduction to object oriented programing with C++.
        </p>

        <p>
          All CS majors are required to take these courses, and a large amount of students take the 161 and 162 courses.
          As soon as I finished CS 162, I began working as a TA for 161.
          At that point, there were around 15 TA’s for the course, and we did everything from grading, to recitation and lab supervision.
          Over the terms the course expanded to requiring recitations, administering coding exams at the end of the term, a staff of over 30 TA’s and the cap on students doubling from about 200 to a little over 400 students.
          I worked as a TA for every fall, winter and spring term from fall 2015 to fall 2017, taking only one term off.
        </p>

        <p>
          During that time, I became increasingly more involved in the curriculum planning and offering resources to both the students and TAs.
          I wrote a grading script in bash to streamline the grading process, I redesigned the website to be mobile friendly, and wrote some web-scraping python scripts to make the process of scheduling TAs easier.
          I used my position as a TA to advocate to the students about the App Development Club, Linux Users Group and Association of Computing Machinery, which are on campus organizations where I have worked as an officer for at least the last two years.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a passion for learning and teaching that has driven me throughout my academic career at my university.
          I took the TA job in the hope that I could be a person that made a significant positive impact on those students that have the same passion for their work that I do.

          I did a redesign of the CS 161 website at Oregon State University.
          The original site was tables full of tables, and was almost impossible to navigate on mobile phones.
          The website is edited directly by the TA’s for the course to keep their information updated, so I separated all the information that the TA’s needed to work with into an easy to use JavaScript file.
